1. google a simple article about jquery
2. find the main parts of jquery and research them.
3. find a jquery cheat sheet.
4. check out w3school and other known sites.
5. test after learning something concrete.
6. Take a 5 min break every 30 min.

* I found w3schools the most helpful due to their example code. I like learning when I see an actual example in front of me instead of "x and y then b .z". 
* I read up about how to use jquery in my file and which on to download. Similar to a css file it needs to be required in ruby language.  
* I found the main ways we use jquery, and its purposes which is to make things shorter. It mainly focuses on manipulating html and css files by events or even just text.
* I need a break every hour not half hour.
* I didn't really test my knowledge and I hope to do that in the next release with my project.
