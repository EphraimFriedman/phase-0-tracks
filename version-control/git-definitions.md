# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

##* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a program that saves updates and allows you to go back in time to previous points in the file. This is useful to prevent yourself from permanently destroying your code, and allows you to go back and redo anything. As well, it is useful for multiple users to edit code on their own without messing with the original code. Hence, it controls the different versions.

##* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of a piece of code that you would use to work on to add or update features while not fiddling with the original code, so you don't ruin it. Afterwards, you can request that your update be pulled into the original code

##* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is saving a change. It should have a clear and specific message what the change was.

##* What is a merge conflict?

Merge conflict is when two people work on their separate branches and then try to merge them into the master branch and there is a conflict between both of their codes (both codes can't run i.e. if someone added a code and the other deleted it), so the master branch doesn't know which one to except.
